Description:
HTML (index.html):

The HTML file contains the structure of a simple calculator with a display and buttons for numbers and operations.
CSS (styles.css):

The CSS file provides basic styling for the calculator, display, and buttons.
JavaScript (script.js):

The JavaScript file includes functions to append values to the display, clear the display, and calculate the result using the eval function.
Usage:
Open index.html in a web browser.
Use the number and operation buttons to input your expression.
Click the "=" button to calculate the result.
Click the "C" button to clear the display.
Note: The use of eval for calculation is convenient but has security implications, especially if the input comes from an untrusted source. In a production environment, consider using a more secure method for expression evaluation.
